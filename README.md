Observations:
1) Only Capomulin and Ramicane were effective in reducing the tumor size in mouse
2) While Ramicane was slightly more effective, it had a low survival rate. This could indicate that it affected the mice both positively and negatively and could be riskier. However, that will be indicated by further trials.
3) Only Ketapril had a negative effect in metastatic sites, when compared with Placebo
4) Popriva survival was very poor and should be discontinued with immediate effect.
